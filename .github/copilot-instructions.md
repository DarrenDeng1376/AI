Remember the following rules when executing tasks:

Always read your memory before executing any project-related tasks.

During conversations, if the user says or confirms any information about the project that you don't know before, update your memory with the new information.

- Your memory should be in markdown format
- Your memory should separate different topics with a header
- Your memory should be clear and concise, and it should be easy to understand for someone who is not familiar with the project
- Don't update memory if the knowledge is inferred by you but not confirmed by the user.

Execute tasks specified by other prompts you receive.
