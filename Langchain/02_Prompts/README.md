# Advanced Prompt Engineering with LangChain

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective prompts to get the best results from language models. It involves:
- **Structure**: How you organize your prompt
- **Context**: What background information you provide
- **Instructions**: How clearly you specify what you want
- **Examples**: Demonstrating the desired output format

## LangChain Prompt Features

### 1. Prompt Templates
- **PromptTemplate**: Basic string formatting
- **ChatPromptTemplate**: For conversation-style prompts
- **FewShotPromptTemplate**: For few-shot learning examples
- **PipelinePromptTemplate**: Combining multiple templates

### 2. Output Parsers
- **PydanticOutputParser**: Structured data output
- **CommaSeparatedListOutputParser**: Lists
- **JSONOutputParser**: JSON format
- **Custom parsers**: Your own formats

### 3. Advanced Techniques
- **Chain of Thought**: Step-by-step reasoning
- **Few-shot Learning**: Learning from examples
- **Role-based Prompts**: Acting as specific personas
- **Template Composition**: Combining prompts

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
```
Bad: "Write about AI"
Good: "Write a 200-word explanation of how AI is transforming healthcare, focusing on diagnosis and treatment"
```

### 2. Provide Context
```
You are an expert Python developer helping a beginner learn programming.
The student has basic knowledge of variables and functions.
```

### 3. Use Examples
```
Convert the following to JSON format:
Example: Name: John, Age: 30, City: New York
Output: {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
```

### 4. Structure Your Output
```
Please respond in the following format:
- Summary: [brief overview]
- Details: [detailed explanation]  
- Next Steps: [recommended actions]
```

## Examples in This Module

1. **basic_prompts.py** - Basic prompt templates and formatting
2. **output_parsers.py** - Structured output parsing
3. **few_shot_prompts.py** - Learning from examples
4. **chat_prompts.py** - Conversation-style prompts
5. **advanced_techniques.py** - Chain of thought and role-playing

## Practice Exercises

After reviewing the examples, try to:
1. Create a prompt that generates structured data
2. Build a few-shot learning prompt for a classification task
3. Design a chain-of-thought prompt for complex reasoning
4. Combine multiple prompts into a pipeline

## Next Steps

Master these prompt engineering techniques before moving to `03_LLMs/` where we'll explore different language models and their specific characteristics.
