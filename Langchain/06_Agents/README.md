# AI Agents - Autonomous Decision Making

## Overview

Agents are AI systems that can make decisions, use tools, and take actions to accomplish goals. This module covers building autonomous agents with LangChain.

## What are Agents?

Agents combine:
- **Reasoning**: Understanding what needs to be done
- **Planning**: Deciding how to accomplish tasks
- **Tool Usage**: Accessing external resources and APIs
- **Memory**: Learning from previous interactions
- **Action**: Executing steps to reach goals

## Types of Agents

### 1. **ReAct Agent**
- **Re**asoning + **Act**ing pattern
- Thinks about what to do, then takes action
- Best for: General purpose tasks

### 2. **Zero-Shot React**
- Makes decisions without examples
- Uses only tool descriptions
- Best for: Simple, well-defined tools

### 3. **Structured Tool Chat**
- Uses structured input/output for tools
- Better error handling
- Best for: Complex tool interactions

### 4. **OpenAI Functions**
- Uses OpenAI's function calling
- More reliable tool selection
- Best for: Production applications

### 5. **Custom Agents**
- Built for specific domains
- Custom reasoning patterns
- Best for: Specialized use cases

## Key Components

### Tools
- **Search**: Web search, database queries
- **APIs**: REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints
- **File Operations**: Read, write, process files
- **Calculations**: Math, data analysis
- **Communication**: Email, chat, notifications

### Memory
- **Short-term**: Current conversation context
- **Long-term**: Persistent knowledge storage
- **Episodic**: Past interaction memories
- **Semantic**: General knowledge facts

### Planning
- **Single-step**: Direct tool usage
- **Multi-step**: Complex task breakdown
- **Hierarchical**: Goals and sub-goals
- **Adaptive**: Plan adjustment based on results

## Examples in This Module

1. **basic_agents.py** - Simple agent implementations
2. **tool_usage.py** - Agents with external tools
3. **custom_tools.py** - Building specialized tools
4. **multi_agent.py** - Coordinating multiple agents
5. **agent_memory.py** - Agents with persistent memory

## Common Agent Patterns

### Research Assistant
```
Query → Search → Analyze → Synthesize → Report
```

### Task Automation
```
Request → Plan → Execute → Monitor → Complete
```

### Customer Support
```
Question → Classify → Route → Resolve → Follow-up
```

### Data Analysis
```
Data → Clean → Analyze → Visualize → Insights
```

## Best Practices

### Agent Design
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Give clear tool descriptions
- Implement proper error handling
- Add safety constraints
- Test with edge cases

### Tool Integration
- Use reliable, well-documented APIs
- Implement retry mechanisms
- Add input validation
- Handle rate limits
- Log tool usage for debugging

### Safety & Control
- Set execution limits (time, cost, iterations)
- Implement human approval for sensitive actions
- Add content filtering
- Monitor agent behavior
- Provide override mechanisms

## Next Steps

Master agents, then explore:

2. `08_VectorStores/` - Knowledge storage
3. Multi-agent systems and coordination
4. Agent deployment and monitoring
