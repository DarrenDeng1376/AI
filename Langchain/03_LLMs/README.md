# Working with Different Language Models

## Overview

This module covers how to work with different LLM providers in LangChain. You'll learn to integrate various models, understand their strengths, and switch between providers seamlessly.

## Supported LLM Providers

### 1. **OpenAI** (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
- Best for: General purpose, reasoning, code generation
- Strengths: High quality, fast, well-documented
- Use cases: Chatbots, content generation, analysis

### 2. **Anthropic** (Claude)
- Best for: Safety, long contexts, analysis
- Strengths: Ethical reasoning, large context windows
- Use cases: Document analysis, content moderation

### 3. **Google** (Gemini, PaLM)
- Best for: Multimodal tasks, structured data
- Strengths: Integration with Google services
- Use cases: Search, data analysis, code assistance

### 4. **Local Models** (Ollama, LM Studio)
- Best for: Privacy, cost control, customization
- Strengths: No API costs, offline usage
- Use cases: Sensitive data, high-volume applications

## Key Concepts

### Model Parameters
- **Temperature**: Controls randomness (0-1)
- **Max Tokens**: Maximum response length
- **Top-p**: Nucleus sampling parameter
- **Frequency Penalty**: Reduces repetition

### Model Selection Criteria
- **Task Type**: Choose based on use case
- **Cost**: Balance performance vs. price
- **Latency**: Speed requirements
- **Context Length**: How much text the model can process

### Best Practices
- Start with established providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Test different models for your specific use case
- Monitor costs and usage
- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Use appropriate model sizes for tasks

## Examples in This Module

1. **multiple_providers.py** - Using different LLM providers
2. **model_comparison.py** - Comparing model outputs
3. **cost_optimization.py** - Managing costs and usage
4. **local_models.py** - Running models locally
5. **model_selection.py** - Choosing the right model

## Model Comparison

| Provider | Model | Context | Strengths | Best For |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------|----------|
| OpenAI | GPT-4 | 8K/32K | Reasoning, accuracy | Complex tasks |
| OpenAI | GPT-3.5 | 4K | Speed, cost-effective | Simple tasks |
| Anthropic | Claude-3 | 200K | Safety, long context | Document analysis |
| Google | Gemini Pro | 30K | Multimodal | Vision + text tasks |

## Cost Considerations

### Token Pricing (approximate)
- GPT-4: $0.03/1K input, $0.06/1K output
- GPT-3.5: $0.0015/1K input, $0.002/1K output
- Claude-3: $0.015/1K input, $0.075/1K output

### Cost Optimization Tips
1. Use smaller models for simple tasks
2. Implement caching for repeated queries
3. Optimize prompts to reduce token usage
4. Set max token limits
5. Monitor usage with dashboards

## Next Steps
